<strong><?php bloginfo('name');?></strong> is made possible by WordPress, TextMate and lots of coffee. I write all the contents here--not as often as I'd like, because I still have a day job as software development manager. In case you're wondering what the name of this theme is--well I don't really have a name for it yet, but I think I'll call it the Stubborn theme.  I also write at <a href="http://fornoobs.info">ForNoobs.info</a> and if there's more time left, I twitter a little too--if you would like to follow, it's <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tedheich">@tedheich</a>. You can <a href="/contact" class="smcf-link">drop me a note here.</a>
